<text size = 12>
<ol>
<li>High level description of project:<br>
Plan sponsors are interested in forecasting their pension plan's funded status. The funded status 
is the ratio of plan liability to plan assets.  Many plan sponsrs hedge their asset portfolio against
movement in corporate bond rates so that rate changes do not adversely affect funded status.
I want to explore alternative indicators for funded status movement.

<br>
<li>What question or problem are you trying to solve?<br>
I will try to predict a plan's funded status using publicly available data on the 
plan and plan sponsor.

<br>
<li>How will you present your work?<br>
I will use a presentation with slides.

<br>
<li>What are your data sources?<br>
Funded status is available via the Form 5500 Schedule SB and is publicly available:
